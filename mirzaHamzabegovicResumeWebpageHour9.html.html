<!-- In my first hour I looked up examples of other personal resumes, until I decided how I want mine to look. After that I tried uploading several images just to practice different flex options. Next step I set up position and border radius of my profile picture. After that added unordered lists to both sides.-->
<!-- For my second hour I realised that I lost too much time on trying to get my cv look good. This time I added rest of the html elements with my info.I had some struggles with elements going across each other and eventually my background image , after some research Ifound the magic word background-size:cover;..-->
<!-- In this third hour my focus was on making the page responsive, most of my time I spent figuring out how it works, and eventually for start I tried making the profile picture fit the screen. Not super proud of this hour but it is what it is.Next stop is trying to fit all the other elements and maybe picking a better style.-->
<!-- In this hour my main goal was to try and setup my page  so it looks like something on smaller screens. Spent some time researching, eventually had to move element by element, code looks messy but it works, still need some practice.-->
<!-- On my fifth hour I tried changing the look of my html file to make it more appealing. Added some new fonts and letter spacing -->
<!-- Last hour I didn't do much, I started doubting my html structure as long as div and containers go. I went through code to try and make it look cleaner since I had alot of unneccesary code that wasnt used at all in the css file. Hopefully I will get more practice in the future since this is only the beginning and im not losing hope..-->
<!-- Hour number 7, I decided to redo most of my code and input more divs for better content management, its time consuming but its going to pay in the end. Added new features, this is going to take more than 3 hours probably, but ill just post this so you can see my progress, and last few hours as my last third.-->
<!-- Hour 8, managed to rechange the whole code to make it more viable with media query, cleaned up the code and split into sections with more divs for easier manipulation of elements, set up the whole container in grid for easier management later, still not satisfied with head content (right fieldset),going to continue in the morning to find out a solution for fieldset and set up the media queries-->
<!-- Last hour, I decided to remove the fieldset and make a new section on the bottom, setup the links on the icons to my profile, added media query to switch grid area to one column, set the image to responsive.spent alot of time going back and checking the code. Its not much but its honest work.Looking forward to future projects. -->
